# UBER-Fare-prediction 

The project is about on world's largest taxi company Uber inc. In this project, we're looking to predict the fare for their future transactional cases.
Uber delivers service to lakhs of customers daily. Now it becomes really important to manage their data properly to come up with new business ideas to get best results. Eventually, it becomes really important to estimate the fare prices accurately.

Steps we performed:
  *Importing libraries
  *Reading csv file
  *Dropping columns
  *Checking Null Values
  *Checking Duplicates
  *Convert Dtypes
  *Handling columns
  *Slicing
  *Visualizing
  *Predictive Analysis
  *Conclusion
  
Algorithms we used:
  *Linear Regression
  *Random Forest
  *Decision Tree
  *XGBoost
  
Normaly accuracy value is more then 80% but some companies ask 60%, here we got 52 to 69% with help of Liner Regression,Random forest,Decision Tree.
Here hepl of XGBoost got 72%, XGBoost is designed for speed, ease of use, and performance on large datasets. It does not require optimization of the parameters or tuning, which means that it can be used immediately after installation without any further configuration.
It's designed to help you build better models and works by combining decision trees and gradient boosting. That is why we are used XGBoost.
